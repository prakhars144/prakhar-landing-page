					<h1>Welcome, friend.</h1>
					<p>
						In the post-apocalyptic wasteland of New Haven, where remnants of the old world lie in ruins and
						survival hinges on ingenuity, stands <strong>Prakhar</strong>, a software engineer of
						unparalleled skill. Amidst the rubble and radiation, Prakhar harnesses the power of C++ to build
						and maintain the digital fortresses that keep his community safe.
					</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p>
						By day, he navigates the complexities of WebRTC and web technologies, deploying resilient
						systems that withstand the harshest conditions. His expertise in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
						and Large Language Models transforms scarce data into vital intelligence, while his mastery of
						AWS ensures that even in a world gone dark, his networks remain robust and reliable.
					</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p>
						When the sun dips below the horizon and the wasteland is cloaked in shadows, Prakhar retreats to
						his bunker. Here, amidst the hum of generators and the glow of ancient monitors, he indulges in
						his passion for game development. Using the Godot engine, he creates virtual worlds that offer a
						glimpse of hope and escapism, a testament to the enduring power of creativity.
					</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p>
						Prakhar is not just a survivor; he is a beacon of innovation in a desolate world, a creator
						whose work bridges the remnants of the past with the promise of the future. His story is one of
						resilience, ingenuity, and an unyielding drive to rebuild and inspire.
					</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p><strong>Endure. Innovate.</strong></p>
