                        <h1>Welcome, friend.</h1>
                        <p>
                            In the post-apocalyptic wasteland of New Haven,
                            where remnants of the old world lie in ruins and
                            survival hinges on ingenuity, stands
                            <strong>Prakhar</strong>, a software engineer of
                            unparalleled skill. Amidst the rubble and radiation,
                            Prakhar harnesses the power of C++ to build and
                            maintain the digital fortresses that keep his
                            community safe.
                        </p>
                        <br /><br />
                        <p>
                            By day, he navigates the complexities of Kubernetes
                            and Docker, deploying resilient systems that
                            withstand the harshest conditions. His expertise in
                            Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Large Language
                            Models transforms scarce data into vital
                            intelligence, while his mastery of AWS ensures that
                            even in a world gone dark, his networks remain
                            robust and reliable.
                        </p>
                        <br /><br />
                        <p>
                            When the sun dips below the horizon and the
                            wasteland is cloaked in shadows, Prakhar retreats to
                            his bunker. Here, amidst the hum of generators and
                            the glow of ancient monitors, he indulges in his
                            passion for game development. Using the Godot
                            engine, he creates virtual worlds that offer a
                            glimpse of hope and escapism, a testament to the
                            enduring power of creativity.
                        </p>
                        <br /><br />
                        <p>
                            Prakhar is not just a survivor; he is a beacon of
                            innovation in a desolate world, a creator whose work
                            bridges the remnants of the past with the promise of
                            the future. His story is one of resilience,
                            ingenuity, and an unyielding drive to rebuild and
                            inspire.
